# spring-playground

This repository contains a web appliction build in Java with Spring. It is a personal project for:

1. lerning in-depth Spring framework (spring-boot, spring-data, spring-boot-validation);
2. applying best programming designs, methodologies and conventions;
3. understanding Web Applictions as a business product.

Until now some key aspects I work on are: exception handling and validation in Spring, and Unit and Integration testing.
